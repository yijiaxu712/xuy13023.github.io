Hi, I’m **Yijia Xu** — I currently volunteer with [We Independent] (https://www.weindependent.org), a women-centered NGO supporting dependent-visa holders with mental-health resources, career readiness, and legal literacy. 

My research and professional work have centered on:
- **Educational Inequality** — analyzing large-scale datasets with regression-based designs to study shadow education and socioeconomic disparities.  
- **Policy & Practice** — evaluating K–12 education policies and programs using quantitative methods.
- **Mental Health & Well-Being** — mixed-methods work modeling protective factors and barriers to care among international/minoritized students; integrating semi-structured interviews and classroom/field observations with thematic coding to contextualize quantitative findings.
  
I completed my M.A. in *Educational Theory and Policy* at [Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/) in May 2025. Before that, I earned my B.S. in *Psychology* from [Shenzhen University] (https://en.szu.edu.cn) in China. During my spare time, I enjoy hiking, kayaking cooking and taking photos.
