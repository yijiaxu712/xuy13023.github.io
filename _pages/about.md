Hi, I’m **Yijia Xu**! 

I currently volunteer with [We Independent](https://www.weindependent.org), a women-centered NGO that supports dependent-visa holders through mental health resources, career readiness programs, and legal literacy initiatives.
I earned my M.A. in *Educational Theory and Policy* from [Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/)  in May 2025, after completing a B.S. in *Psychology* at [Shenzhen University](https://en.szu.edu.cn) in China.

My cross-disciplinary background in psychology and education provides me with an analytical lens for examining complex social and educational issues across contexts. My research primarily focuses on:
**Educational Inequality** — Using large-scale datasets (CFPS, PISA) to investigate how socioeconomic and regional disparities shape access to shadow education and student outcomes.
**Policy Evaluation** — Applying quantitative and quasi-experimental methods (e.g., regression, DID, HLM) to assess the effects of K–12 educational reforms.
**Mental Health and Well-Being** — Integrating mixed-methods approaches to explore protective factors and barriers to mental health care among international and minoritized students.

  
I am committed to deepening my understanding of how research can meaningfully inform education policy and practice. In the short term, I hope to continue developing my quantitative research and analytical skills—particularly in policy evaluation and data-driven program assessment—through advanced study and collaborative research opportunities. In the long term, I aspire to contribute to the field as a thoughtful researcher or policy analyst, helping to design and evaluate initiatives that promote equity and inclusion in education. I also hope to stay connected to practice, ensuring that my work remains grounded in the realities of classrooms and communities.
