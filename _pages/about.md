Hi, I’m **Yijia Xu** — I currently volunteer with [We Independent] (https://www.weindependent.org), a women-centered NGO supporting dependent-visa holders with mental-health resources, career readiness, and legal literacy. 

I completed my M.A. in *Educational Theory and Policy* at [Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/) in May 2025. Before that, I earned my B.S. in *Psychology* from [Shenzhen University] (https://en.szu.edu.cn) in China.

My cross-disciplinary training in psychology and education gives me a broad research lens. My interests are primarily focused on:
- **Educational Inequality** — analyzing large-scale datasets with regression-based designs to study shadow education and socioeconomic disparities.  
- **Policy & Practice** — evaluating K–12 education policies and programs using quantitative methods.
- **Mental Health & Well-Being** — mixed-methods work modeling protective factors and barriers to care among international/minoritized students; integrating semi-structured interviews and classroom/field observations with thematic coding to contextualize quantitative findings.

Also, through three volunteer teaching programs serving rural and left-behind children, I witnessed large gaps in resources, teacher capacity, and psychosocial support. These gaps shape not only learning outcomes but also well-being. I aim to produce evidence that travels—actionable insights that reduce inequality and expand opportunity.

During my spare time, I enjoy hiking, kayaking cooking and taking photos.
