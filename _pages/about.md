Hi, I’m **Yijia Xu** — a policy and data analyst passionate about using **quantitative research and statistical modeling** to address questions in education, inequality, and social development.  

I recently completed my **M.A. in Educational Theory and Policy (GPA: 3.98/4.0)** at *Pennsylvania State University*, where I focused on **statistics, behavioral science applications, and quantitative methods**. Before that, I earned my **B.S. in Psychology** from *Shenzhen University*, with a strong foundation in **mathematics, experimental psychology, and data analysis**.  

My research and professional work have centered on:
- **Educational inequality** — analyzing national panel datasets (e.g., PISA, TIMSS, ACS) to study shadow education and socioeconomic disparities.  
- **Quantitative methods** — regression, panel data models, factor analysis, and survey design.  
- **Policy and practice** — projects on mental health help-seeking, tutoring participation, and decision-making in higher education.  

I have hands-on experience with **Stata, R, SQL, Tableau, and SPSS**, and I enjoy building clean, reproducible workflows that transform complex data into clear insights.
