Hi, I’m **Yijia Xu** — I currently volunteer with [We Independent](https://www.weindependent.org), a women-centered NGO supporting dependent-visa holders with mental-health resources, career readiness, and legal literacy. 

I completed my M.A. in *Educational Theory and Policy* at [Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/) in May 2025. Before that, I earned my B.S. in *Psychology* from [Shenzhen University](https://en.szu.edu.cn) in China.

My cross-disciplinary training in psychology and education gives me a broad research lens. My interests are primarily focused on:
- **Educational Inequality** — analyzing large-scale datasets with regression-based designs to study shadow education and socioeconomic disparities.  
- **Policy & Practice** — evaluating K–12 education policies and programs using quantitative methods.
- **Mental Health & Well-Being** — mixed-methods work modeling protective factors and barriers to care among international/minoritized students; integrating semi-structured interviews and classroom/field observations with thematic coding to contextualize quantitative findings.

Through three volunteer teaching experiences with rural students, students from low-income families, and students on the autism spectrum, I observed how inequities in resources, educator support, and family environments shape educational pathways. I plan to pursue advanced study in education, using empirical, regression-focused research to evaluate programs and translate evidence into actionable guidance. Career-wise, I aim to provide actionable policy advice to governments and schools to reduce inequality and expand opportunity—while maintaining classroom practice to sustain a strong feedback loop between research and implementation.
