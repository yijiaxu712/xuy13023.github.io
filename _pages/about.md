Hi, I’m **Yijia Xu**! 

I currently volunteer with [We Independent](https://www.weindependent.org), a women-centered NGO that supports dependent-visa holders through mental health resources, career readiness programs, and legal literacy initiatives.
I earned my M.A. in *Educational Theory and Policy* from [Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/)  in May 2025, after completing a B.S. in *Psychology* at [Shenzhen University](https://en.szu.edu.cn) in China.

My cross-disciplinary background in psychology and education provides me with a broad analytical lens to examine complex social and educational issues. My primary research interests include:

- **Educational Inequality**: Analyzing large-scale datasets using regression-based methods to explore shadow education and socioeconomic disparities.
- **Policy and Practice**: Evaluating K–12 education policies and programs through quantitative analysis to inform evidence-based decision-making.
- **Mental Health and Well-Being**: Employing mixed-methods approaches to model protective factors and barriers to care among international and minoritized students—integrating semi-structured interviews and classroom or field observations with thematic analysis to contextualize quantitative results.
  
Through three volunteer teaching experiences with rural students, students from low-income families, and students on the autism spectrum, I witnessed firsthand how disparities in resources, teacher support, and family environments shape educational trajectories. These experiences reinforced my commitment to pursuing advanced study in education—using empirical, regression-driven research to evaluate programs and transform data into actionable policy insights.
Ultimately, I aspire to provide practical policy recommendations for governments and schools to reduce inequality and expand opportunity, while maintaining classroom engagement to ensure a continuous feedback loop between research and real-world practice.
