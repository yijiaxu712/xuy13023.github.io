**Abstract**
Shadow education has increasingly become a popular global phenomenon. Many policies and measures have been introduced to alleviate the inequality caused by shadow education and to reduce students' academic burdens. For example, on July 24th, 2021, the Chinese government introduced the "Double Reduction" policy, aiming to reduce the academic burden on students and regulate the growth of off-campus tutoring. However, empirical studies examining the effectiveness of this policy remain limited. This study utilized nationally representative data from the China Family Panel Survey (CFPS) collected in 2020 and 2022 to examine the overall changes in the use of shadow education before and after the policy's implementation. Specifically, this study compared the participation rate of different types of tutoring and across different regions. Additionally, the study examined the use of shadow education across different socioeconomic status (SES) levels. By providing empirical evidence, this research offers a clearer understanding of the Double Reduction policy's effectiveness and its impact on students from varying family background.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images, even citations {% cite einstein1950meaning %}.
Say you wanted to write a bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
